                <h4> Outbreak </h4>
                <p> The zombie apocalypse has finally come; the entire world is 
                    covered with zombies. If you are still alive (and you haven't 
                    seen AMC's hit series, "The Walking Dead") then you must know 
                    that these zombies are dangerous. They are not your friends, 
                    mothers, brothers, and fathers anymore; they are now the 
                    living dead. Zombies are highly infections and they will try 
                    to bite you. If you are bitten by a zombie you will become 
                    one of them in a matter of hours.  </p>

                <h4> Why? </h4>
                <p> There was a outbreak at the CDC in Atlanta, and the personnel 
                    were experimenting a new virus on a dead subject- Which 
                    resulted in a failure, and began to spread on everyone, and 
                    got even worse, when it was exposed to the public by a single 
                    person. We do not know when it will stop, but we do know that
                    you should not give up! No matter how many of your loved ones
                    are now flesh eating monsters!</p>
